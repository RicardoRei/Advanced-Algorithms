# String Matching Algorithms for DNA

The first part of the Advanced Algorithms and Datastructures Course project. The project consisted in implementing Knuth-Moris-Pratt algorithm, Boyer-Moore algorithm and a Naive algorithm to find the positions where a pattern P appears in a text T. You can read the StringMatching_report.pdf for more info.

## Getting Started

To launch the project just open a shell and run the following compiling line: 
gcc -ansi -Wall -pedantic -o test StringMatching.c

after the code is compiled you just need to run the following command in you shell: ./test
